Timer Demo

Some quick notes: 

The values for the tableview are loaded from a plist called TimerTableArray.plist

I generated some documentation using a tool called appledoc.  It makes the comments a little longer than I usually do.  It makes my comments a little more verbose than I usually write.

No test cases
