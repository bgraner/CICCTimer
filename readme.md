Timer Demo

Some quick notes: I made a few assumptions about the look and feel.  From the email it seemed that the goal was more to look at my code than any particulars in the UI.

I generated this project from the boilerplate master/detail code apple provides.  I left the core data stuff in the app delegate.

The values for the tableview are loaded from a plist called TimerTableArray.plist

I generated some documentation using a tool called appledoc.  It makes the comments a little longer than I usually do.  Not quite sure if I like it or not - the generated documentation pages look nice but do make the comments in the code a bit verbose/distracting.  Kind of curious to know what you think.
